    "Let's unpack these two ideas in the context of the radioactive decay example. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We argued earlier that we could not be precisely sure of the underlying setting of the decay constant $\\lambda$ given the observed data. Probabilistic inference acknowledges this fact and says that we should not return a single estimate of $\\lambda$, but rather a distribution $p(\\lambda | \\{ x_n \\}_{n=1}^N)$ that indicates the plausibility of any setting of $\\lambda$ given the observed data $\\{ x_n \\}_{n=1}^N$.\n",
    "\n",

Bayes' rule also requires we specify our prior knowledge about the decay constant, $p(\\lambda)$, which we will discuss below. Before we do this, notice that together the prior $p(\\lambda)$ and the probability of the observed data given the decay constant $p( x_n | \\lambda )$ specify a complete probabilistic recipe for generating datasets (by first sampling $\\lambda$ and then sampling $N$ observed data from $p(\\{ x_n \\}_{n=1}^N | \\lambda )$). This is sometimes called a **forward model** as it moves from the unknown variables to the observed variables. Inference is sometimes called **inverse modelling** as it moves from the observed variables to the unknown variables. \n",

As a result, in the posterior, this data point contributes weak evidence that the underlying vaue of $\\lambda$ is close to $15$. It rules out very small settings of $\\lambda$ (the decay event was seen at too large a value of $x$ to be consistent with a short decay constant), but it is ambivalent toward higher values of $\\lambda$ (afterall, in the limit of large $\\lambda$  we are equally likely to see the decay event at any location within the device so _any_ single decay cannot rule out large decay constants).

    "Prediction is a fundamental part of science and engineering. The probabilistic approach says:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. that the answer to this question is the probability of the location next decay event $x^\\star$ given the observed data $\\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^N$, that is $p(x^\\star \\lvert \\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^N)$. This is known as the predictive distribution.\n",

    "p(x^\\star \\lvert \\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^N) &= \\int p(x^\\star,\\lambda \\lvert \\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^N) \\text{d} \\lambda \\;\\;\\; \\text{(sum rule)}\\\\\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The last line follows from that fact that if we know $\\lambda$ then, under the model we are assuming, the data set $\\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^N$ provides no additional information about $x^\\star $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictive distribution has an intuitive form: it takes the prediction we would make if we knew $\\lambda$, $p(x^\\star \\lvert  \\lambda)$, weights it by the probability under the posterior $p(\\lambda | \\{x_n\\}_{n=1}^N)$, and sums this quatity over all settings of $\\lambda$. For this reason the probabilistic predictive distribution above is sometimes called the **posterior predictive**.\n",

Let $n_{ab} \\in \\{n_{00}, n_{01}, n_{10}, n_{11}\\}$ denote the number of (equiprobable) outcomes for which A is true/false and B is true/false depending on the indices: e.g. $n_{01}$ denotes the number of outcomes for which A is false and B is true. Then defining $N = n_{00} + n_{01} + n_{10} + n_{11}$\n\n\\begin{align}\np(A|B) = \\frac{n_{11}}{n_{01} + n_{11}} = \\frac{\\frac{n_{11}}{N}}{\\frac{n_{01} + n_{11}}{N}} = \\frac{p(A \\cap B)}{p(B)}\n\\end{align}\n\nthrough which we obtain the required result from which Bayes’ rule follows.
